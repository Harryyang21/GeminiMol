## download models

Due to file size limitations, the GeminiMol models were stored in the [Zenodo repository](10.5281/zenodo.10273480). This includes all Cross-Encoder models and two Binary-Encoder models, GeminiMol and GeminiMol-MOD in the paper.

To use these models, put them under the ```${GeminiMol}/models/```.
