# GeminiMol
This repository provides the official implementation of the GeminiMol model, training data, and scripts.  

We also provide:   

1.  Scripts for data collection and analysis.    
2.  A benchmark script and datasets for virtual screening, target identification, and QSAR (drug-target binding affinity, cellar activity, ADME, and toxicity).   
3.  Benchmark results of molecular fingerprints and GeminiMol models.   

Please also refer to our paper for a detailed description of this method.
