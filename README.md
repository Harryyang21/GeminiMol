This repository provides the official implementation of the GeminiMol model, training data, and scripts.  

We also provide:   

1.  Scripts for data collection and analysis.    
2.  A benchmark script and datasets for virtual screening, target identification, and QSAR (drug-target binding affinity, cellar activity, ADME, and toxicity).   
3.  Benchmark results of molecular fingerprints and GeminiMol models.   

_Please also refer to our paper for a detailed description of GeminiMol._

## Motivation  

_The **molecular representation model** is an emerging artificial intelligence technology for extracting features of small molecules. It has been **widely applied in drug discovery scenarios**, such as **virtual screening**, Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship (**QSAR**) analysis, and **molecular optimization**._   
  
_In previous work, molecular representation models were mostly trained on the static structure of molecules, however, the small molecules in solution are highly dynamic, and their flexible conformational changes endow them with the potential to bind to drug targets. Therefore, introducing information on small molecule conformational space into molecular representation models is a promising aim. In this work, a training strategy, named GeminiMol, was proposed to **incorporate the comprehension of conformational space into the molecular representation model**._   

_The similarity between small molecules provides the opportunity for contrastive learning, as illustrated in followed figure, the shape similarity contained more pharmacological and physical information than the 2D structure and fingerprint similarity, therefore, **introducing the molecular shape similarity in contrastive learning is a promising strategy**._

_In this study, a diverse collection of **39,290** molecules was employed for conformational searching and shape alignment to generate a comprehensive dataset of molecular conformational space similarity. Various hyperparameters were employed during the conformational search process, and a multi-task learning approach was adopted to facilitate the model in acquiring a universal representation of molecular conformational space. To assess the model's performance, the **benchmark datasets comprising over millions molecules** was utilized for downstream tasks._    

## Application

_As a potent molecular representation model, GeminiMol finds applications in **ligand-based virtual screening, target identification, and quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR)** modeling of small molecular drugs. Moreover, by exploring the encoding space of GeminiMol, it enables **scaffold hopping** and facilitates the generation of innovative molecules._

_To ensure the accurate evaluation of the model's performance, we have additionally devised a competitive-performance baseline method utilizing molecular fingerprints. This baseline method has demonstrated competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art traditional methods in the application tasks. GeminiMol has demonstrated comparable or even superior performance compared to the current state-of-the-art baseline method in various statistical metrics across these tasks. Furthermore, it demonstrates a remarkable ability to attain balanced superior performance across multiple diverse tasks **without the necessity of additional fine-tuning or hyperparameter readjustment**._

## Installation

_GeminiMol is a python-based AI model. To set up the GeminiMol model, we recommend using conda for Python environment configuration._

    wget https://repo.continuum.io/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh
    sh Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh
```
> create GeminiMol env
```
    conda create -n GeminiMol python=3.8.16
    conda activate GeminiMol
```
> download GeminiMol and configuration
```
    git clone https://github.com/Wang-Lin-boop/GeminiMol
    cd GeminiMol/
    export PATH=${PWD}:\$PATH" >> ~/.bashrc
    export GeminiMol=${PWD}" >> ~/.bashrc
    cd geminimol/
    export geminimol_app=${PWD}" >> ~/.bashrc
    cd ../model
    export geminimol_lib=${PWD}" >> ~/.bashrc
    source ~/.bashrc
```

#### Baseline Fingerprint Methods and Benchmark Protocol

_If you intend to utilize molecular fingerprint baseline methods or conduct QSAR benchmarking, it is required to install RDKit and AutoGluon in advance._     

> Installing the RDkit for generating fingerprints

```
    pip install rdkit
```

> Installing the AutoGluon for performing QSAR

``` 
    pip3 install -U pip
    pip3 install -U setuptools wheel
    pip3 install torch==1.13.1+cu116 torchvision==0.14.1+cu116 \
        --extra-index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu116
    pip3 install autogluon==0.7.0
```

> Installing the statatics and plot packages

```
    pip install oddt scikit-learn matplotlib umap-learn
```
